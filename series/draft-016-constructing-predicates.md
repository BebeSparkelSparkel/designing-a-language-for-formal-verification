# Designing a Language for Formal Verification: Constructing Predicates

introduction

definition of subject from 01

note examples of predicates from 013

## Thoughts

Predicates, not subjects, are responsible for some level of subject manipulation.
For example, specifying the maximum allowed memory utilization of a function requires that the subject, probably the function name, be resoved to form that the memory requirements can be calculated from.
This basically means that predicates are funcions on subjects.
