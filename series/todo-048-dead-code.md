## Title
**"Designing a Language for Formal Verification: Dead Code Elimination"**

## Introduction

In [Is it a Function?](link-to-04), we established how to verify function identity across representation levels. In [Reference Resolution](link-to-4.5), we examined the atomic elements within function definitions - ensuring all variables and function calls refer to defined entities. In [Range Analysis](link-to-4.7), we analyzed how subsets of inputs map to subsets of outputs through conditional logic and constraints. Now we turn to **dead code elimination** - identifying and verifying the removal of code that can never be executed.

Dead code elimination represents a crucial step in our progression from static structural analysis to dynamic behavioral verification. While previous articles focused on what code *does*, this article examines what code *cannot do* - specifically, code that cannot be reached during any valid execution. This analysis bridges the gap between understanding function structure and proving function behavior by introducing reachability reasoning that will be essential for totality verification.

We'll demonstrate how to identify unreachable code across representation levels - from obviously unreachable statements after return calls in source code, to unreachable basic blocks in intermediate representations, to dead instruction sequences in machine code. By proving that certain code paths are impossible to reach, we establish the foundation needed for comprehensive behavioral analysis: understanding the complete set of possible execution paths through a function.

This verification challenge introduces control flow analysis techniques while maintaining our multi-level approach, preparing us for the dynamic reasoning required to prove function totality in subsequent articles.

## Context Notes for Article 4.8

### Multi-Level Dead Code Analysis

**Source Code Level:**
- Obviously unreachable statements after returns, breaks, continues
- Unreachable branches in conditional statements with constant conditions
- Unreachable code after infinite loops without break statements

**Parse Tree Level:**
- Structural analysis of AST nodes that cannot be reached through control flow
- Identification of unreachable branches in conditional constructs

**IR Level:**
- Unreachable basic blocks in control flow graphs
- Dead instructions that produce values never used
- Optimization-introduced unreachability

**Machine Code Level:**
- Unreachable instruction sequences
- Dead branches in compiled conditional logic

### Progression from Previous Articles

**Builds on Article 4.5 (Reference Resolution):**
- Uses identified function calls and variable references to trace execution paths
- Determines which references can never be reached

**Builds on Article 4.7 (Range Analysis):**
- Uses input-output constraint analysis to identify impossible conditions
- Leverages conditional logic analysis to find unreachable branches

**Prepares for Article 05 (Function Totality):**
- Introduces control flow reasoning necessary for termination analysis
- Establishes reachability concepts needed for domain coverage proofs

### Verification Targets

**Basic Unreachability:**
- Code after unconditional returns
- Branches with contradictory conditions
- Code in loops that never execute

**Conditional Unreachability:**
- Code reachable only under impossible input conditions
- Branches that require contradictory variable states
- Exception handlers for impossible exception conditions

**Optimization-Related Unreachability:**
- Code eliminated by compiler optimizations
- Unreachable paths introduced by constant folding
- Dead stores and unused computations

### Tactical Approaches

**Control Flow Graph Analysis:**
- Build CFG and identify unreachable nodes
- Verify connectivity between function entry and all code blocks

**Constraint-Based Analysis:**
- Use path conditions to identify impossible execution paths
- Combine with range analysis to find contradictory constraints

**Cross-Level Consistency:**
- Verify that optimizations don't introduce incorrect unreachability
- Ensure dead code elimination preserves semantic equivalence
