## Title
**"Designing a Language for Formal Verification: Reference Resolution"**

## Introduction

In [Is it a Function?](link-to-04), we established how to verify function identity across representation levels - from source text through parse trees to intermediate representations. We demonstrated that the same verification principles can be applied at different abstraction levels, each with its own appropriate techniques. Now we turn to the next logical step: verifying that the atomic elements within function definitions actually refer to defined entities.

**Reference resolution** examines whether all the individual components that make up a function - variable references, function calls, type references, and other identifiers - properly resolve to their declarations. This analysis moves beyond asking "Is this a function?" to asking "Does this function reference only things that exist?"

Consider a function that calls `helper()` or uses variable `x` - reference resolution verifies that `helper` is a defined function and `x` is a declared variable. This seemingly simple question becomes more complex across representation levels: source code may use symbolic names, parse trees structure these references hierarchically, and intermediate representations may transform or optimize these references.

This verification challenge bridges from the structural recognition we established in Article 04 to the relational analysis we'll need for subsequent articles. By ensuring all atomic elements properly resolve, we create the foundation for analyzing how these elements interact - setting the stage for range analysis, dead code elimination, and ultimately behavioral verification.

We'll demonstrate reference resolution across our established multi-level approach, showing how the same logical verification adapts to different representation challenges while maintaining semantic consistency.

## Context Notes for Article 4.5

### Multi-Level Reference Resolution

**Source Code Level:**
- Variable names resolve to declarations within appropriate scopes
- Function calls resolve to function definitions or declarations
- Type references resolve to type definitions
- Import/include statements resolve to external modules

**Parse Tree Level:**
- Identifier nodes in AST link to declaration nodes
- Scope analysis through tree traversal
- Symbol table construction and lookup verification

**IR Level:**
- Variable references resolve to allocation or parameter instructions
- Function calls resolve to function definitions in the module
- Type information preserved through compilation stages

**Machine Code Level:**
- Symbol resolution to memory addresses or registers
- Function calls resolve to correct entry points
- Global variable references resolve to data section addresses

### Types of References to Resolve

**Variable References:**
- Local variables within function scope
- Parameters passed to the function
- Global variables accessible from function context
- Captured variables in closures or nested functions

**Function References:**
- Direct function calls
- Function pointer assignments and calls
- Method calls in object-oriented contexts
- Higher-order function parameters

**Type References:**
- Parameter type declarations
- Return type specifications
- Local variable type annotations
- Generic type parameters

**External References:**
- Imported functions from other modules
- External libraries and system calls
- Standard library functions
- Platform-specific APIs

### Scope and Binding Analysis

**Lexical Scoping:**
- Variable shadowing resolution
- Nested scope traversal
- Block-scoped vs function-scoped variables

**Dynamic Scoping Considerations:**
- Runtime binding resolution where applicable
- Context-dependent reference resolution

**Binding Time Analysis:**
- Compile-time vs runtime binding
- Static vs dynamic dispatch for method calls

### Cross-Level Consistency

**Compilation Preservation:**
- Ensure optimizations don't break reference resolution
- Verify that name mangling preserves semantic relationships
- Check that inlining maintains correct reference semantics

**Representation Mapping:**
- How source-level names map to IR identifiers
- Preservation of reference relationships through compilation stages
- Debug information consistency with actual references

### Error Conditions

**Undefined References:**
- Variables used before declaration
- Calls to non-existent functions
- References to undefined types

**Scope Violations:**
- Variables accessed outside their scope
- Private members accessed from inappropriate contexts
- Module visibility violations

**Type Mismatches:**
- Function calls with incorrect signatures
- Variable assignments with incompatible types
- Generic type parameter violations

### Verification Strategies

**Symbol Table Construction:**
- Build comprehensive symbol tables at each representation level
- Verify completeness and consistency of symbol information

**Reference Graph Analysis:**
- Create graphs of reference relationships
- Verify all references have valid targets
- Check for circular dependencies where problematic

**Cross-Reference Validation:**
- Ensure references maintain consistency across representation levels
- Verify that compilation transformations preserve reference semantics
