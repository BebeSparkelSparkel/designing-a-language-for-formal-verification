# Notes for Article 06: Algorithm Inspection - Additional Abstraction Layers

## Context
These notes capture the additional abstraction layers that are NOT applicable to Article 04 (Is it a Function?) but ARE highly relevant to Article 06. Article 04 focuses on the identity question across representation levels, while this article analyzes algorithmic behavior and properties.

## Article 06: Algorithm Inspection
**Goal**: Proving properties about HOW a function computes its result by analyzing the algorithm implementation.

### Relevant Additional Abstraction Layers:

**Control Flow Graph (CFG)**:
- **Purpose**: Analyze algorithmic structure and complexity
- **Verification target**: Prove algorithmic properties like time/space complexity
- **Tactics needed**: Path analysis, loop bound analysis, complexity metrics
- **Example**: Prove quicksort has O(n log n) average case complexity

**Data Flow Graph**:
- **Purpose**: Track how data transforms through the algorithm
- **Verification target**: Prove algorithmic correctness and invariants
- **Tactics needed**: Invariant analysis, transformation tracking, intermediate state verification
- **Example**: Prove that sorting algorithm maintains array elements (no loss/duplication)

**Call Graph**:
- **Purpose**: Analyze function interaction patterns
- **Verification target**: Prove properties about recursive or composite algorithms
- **Tactics needed**: Recursion analysis, composition verification, call pattern analysis
- **Example**: Prove mutual recursion in parser functions maintains parsing invariants

**Execution Trace**:
- **Purpose**: Runtime algorithmic behavior analysis
- **Verification target**: Prove algorithm behaves as specified during execution
- **Tactics needed**: Trace pattern analysis, state transition verification
- **Example**: Verify that binary search actually halves search space each iteration

**Type Inference Graph**:
- **Purpose**: Analyze how algorithm preserves type properties
- **Verification target**: Prove algorithm maintains type invariants throughout computation
- **Tactics needed**: Type flow analysis, invariant preservation
- **Example**: Prove map function preserves container structure while transforming elements

**Mathematical Model (Operational Semantics)**:
- **Purpose**: Abstract model of algorithmic computation steps
- **Verification target**: Prove algorithm implements intended mathematical operation
- **Tactics needed**: Operational semantics, step-by-step equivalence proofs
- **Example**: Prove iterative factorial computes same result as mathematical definition

### Key Verification Questions for Article 06:
- Does the algorithm implement the intended mathematical operation?
- What are the algorithmic complexity bounds?
- Are algorithmic invariants maintained throughout execution?
- How does the algorithm handle different input patterns?
- Does the implementation match the algorithmic specification?

## Connection to Previous Articles

**From Article 04 to 05**: Once we know something IS a function, we can analyze its totality properties.

**From Article 05 to 06**: Once we know a function is total, we can analyze HOW it computes its results.

**Tactical Evolution**: 
- Article 04: Identity tactics (recognition, classification)
- Article 05: Totality tactics (termination, coverage)
- Article 06: Algorithmic tactics (correctness, complexity, invariants)

**Abstraction Layer Reuse**: The same derived representations (CFG, data flow, etc.) serve different verification purposes across articles, showing the power of your multi-level approach.

## Implementation Notes for Article 06
Focus on correctness and complexity analysis - the "does it work the right way?" question.

**Tool Integration**: Consider how existing tools (complexity analyzers, invariant checkers, operational semantics tools) could integrate with your verification framework at these abstraction layers.
