Proving function totality.

# Notes for Articles 05 & 06: Additional Abstraction Layers

## Context
These notes capture the additional abstraction layers that are NOT applicable to Article 04 (Is it a Function?) but ARE highly relevant to Articles 05 and 06. Article 04 focuses on the identity question across representation levels, while these articles analyze function behavior and properties.

## Article 05: Function Totality
**Goal**: Proving that a function terminates and covers its entire input domain.

### Relevant Additional Abstraction Layers:

**Control Flow Graph (CFG)**:
- **Purpose**: Analyze termination properties
- **Verification target**: Prove all execution paths lead to return statements
- **Tactics needed**: Loop analysis, recursive call analysis, reachability analysis
- **Example**: Show that factorial(n) terminates for all non-negative integers

**Data Flow Graph**:
- **Purpose**: Track how inputs are processed
- **Verification target**: Prove function covers entire input space
- **Tactics needed**: Input domain analysis, range checking, precondition validation
- **Example**: Prove division function handles all inputs except divide-by-zero

**Execution Trace Analysis**:
- **Purpose**: Runtime behavior verification
- **Verification target**: Empirical evidence of totality across test cases
- **Tactics needed**: Trace analysis, pattern recognition, coverage metrics
- **Example**: Verify sorting function terminates on all tested input sizes

**Dependency Graph**:
- **Purpose**: Analyze what function depends on for termination
- **Verification target**: Prove termination doesn't depend on external non-terminating resources
- **Tactics needed**: Dependency analysis, resource tracking
- **Example**: Prove function doesn't depend on potentially infinite I/O operations

**Mathematical Model (Sets/Relations)**:
- **Purpose**: Abstract mathematical verification of totality
- **Verification target**: Prove function as mathematical relation is total
- **Tactics needed**: Domain/codomain analysis, mathematical induction
- **Example**: Prove function represents a total mathematical function from   

### Key Verification Questions for Article 05:
- Does every input in the domain produce an output?
- Do all execution paths terminate?
- Are there any infinite loops or unbounded recursion?
- Does the function handle edge cases and boundary conditions?

## Article 06: Algorithm Inspection
**Goal**: Proving properties about HOW a function computes its result by analyzing the algorithm implementation.

### Relevant Additional Abstraction Layers:

**Control Flow Graph (CFG)**:
- **Purpose**: Analyze algorithmic structure and complexity
- **Verification target**: Prove algorithmic properties like time/space complexity
- **Tactics needed**: Path analysis, loop bound analysis, complexity metrics
- **Example**: Prove quicksort has O(n log n) average case complexity

**Data Flow Graph**:
- **Purpose**: Track how data transforms through the algorithm
- **Verification target**: Prove algorithmic correctness and invariants
- **Tactics needed**: Invariant analysis, transformation tracking, intermediate state verification
- **Example**: Prove that sorting algorithm maintains array elements (no loss/duplication)

**Call Graph**:
- **Purpose**: Analyze function interaction patterns
- **Verification target**: Prove properties about recursive or composite algorithms
- **Tactics needed**: Recursion analysis, composition verification, call pattern analysis
- **Example**: Prove mutual recursion in parser functions maintains parsing invariants

**Execution Trace**:
- **Purpose**: Runtime algorithmic behavior analysis
- **Verification target**: Prove algorithm behaves as specified during execution
- **Tactics needed**: Trace pattern analysis, state transition verification
- **Example**: Verify that binary search actually halves search space each iteration

**Type Inference Graph**:
- **Purpose**: Analyze how algorithm preserves type properties
- **Verification target**: Prove algorithm maintains type invariants throughout computation
- **Tactics needed**: Type flow analysis, invariant preservation
- **Example**: Prove map function preserves container structure while transforming elements

**Mathematical Model (Operational Semantics)**:
- **Purpose**: Abstract model of algorithmic computation steps
- **Verification target**: Prove algorithm implements intended mathematical operation
- **Tactics needed**: Operational semantics, step-by-step equivalence proofs
- **Example**: Prove iterative factorial computes same result as mathematical definition

### Key Verification Questions for Article 06:
- Does the algorithm implement the intended mathematical operation?
- What are the algorithmic complexity bounds?
- Are algorithmic invariants maintained throughout execution?
- How does the algorithm handle different input patterns?
- Does the implementation match the algorithmic specification?

## Cross-Article Connections

**From Article 04 to 05**: Once we know something IS a function, we can analyze its totality properties.

**From Article 05 to 06**: Once we know a function is total, we can analyze HOW it computes its results.

**Tactical Evolution**: 
- Article 04: Identity tactics (recognition, classification)
- Article 05: Totality tactics (termination, coverage)
- Article 06: Algorithmic tactics (correctness, complexity, invariants)

**Abstraction Layer Reuse**: The same derived representations (CFG, data flow, etc.) serve different verification purposes across articles, showing the power of your multi-level approach.

## Implementation Notes

**For Article 05**: Focus on termination analysis and domain coverage - the "does it work for all inputs?" question.

**For Article 06**: Focus on correctness and complexity analysis - the "does it work the right way?" question.

**Tool Integration**: Consider how existing tools (model checkers, static analyzers, complexity analyzers) could integrate with your verification framework at these abstraction layers.
